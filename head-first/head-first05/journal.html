      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting
      places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Boundtiful, UT, Last
      Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth or Consequences, NM.

      My first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got everything packed
      and ready to go. Because I’m on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring a whole
      lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the
      essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a thousand miles
      begins with one Segway.”
